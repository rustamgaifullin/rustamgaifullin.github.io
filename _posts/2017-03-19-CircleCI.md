I recently decided to use Circle CI as Continuous Integration for my Android project.  
I opened circleci's website click sign up choose my GitHub account configured my project...and build failed.

The problem was with the license agreements which I didn't accept (yeah right how do I suppose to accept those?)  
Fast googling showed me several solutions which worked perfect except the fact that they didn't.

## First attempt
To accept the license agreements I added one line in circle.yml:
```yaml
- echo yes | android update sdk --no-ui --all -filter "android-25,build-tools-25.0.0,extra-android-m2repository"
```

Apparently for simple project it might be enough, mine wasn't so simple...

## Second attempt
The problem was with the Constraint Layout library:
> You have not accepted the license agreements of the following SDK components: [ConstraintLayout for Android 1.0.2, Solver for ConstraintLayout 1.0.2]

So I found better solution with caching from circleci employee (at least title said so):
```yaml
dependencies:
  pre:
    # Android SDK Platform 25
    - if [ ! -d "/usr/local/android-sdk-linux/platforms/android-25" ]; then echo y | android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter "android-25"; fi
    # Android SDK Build-tools, revision 25.0.0
    - if [ ! -d "/usr/local/android-sdk-linux/build-tools/25.0.5" ]; then echo y | android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter "build-tools-25.0.5"; fi
    # Android Support Repository, revision 39 / Local Maven repository for Support Libraries
    - if [ ! -d "/usr/local/android-sdk-linux/extras/android/m2repository/com/android/support/design/25.0.0" ]; then echo y | android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter "extra-android-m2repository"; fi


  cache_directories:
    - /usr/local/android-sdk-linux/platforms/android-25
    - /usr/local/android-sdk-linux/build-tools/25.0.0
    - /usr/local/android-sdk-linux/extras/android/m2repository
```
Ok he said that it should work...trying...failed.

## Third attempt
Some guy in the stackoverflow said that I need to put licenses from my local machine to circleci...Sounds a bit weird right?
Not exactly. In build logs I found interesting message:

> Before building your project, you need to accept the license agreements and complete the installation of the missing components using the Android Studio SDK Manager.
> Alternatively, to learn how to transfer the license agreements from one workstation to another, go to http://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/export-licenses.html

Wow even google tried to say me so many time that I can transfer the license agreements and I ignored it. Ok lets put them in circleci!

## Final solution
Easiest way to resolve the problem is copy the license agreements to repository and add one copying line in circle.yml.

But I decided to hide the license agreements inside environment variables. I copied everything (1 line actually) from android-sdk-license file and add as a variable in circleci.
![Environment variables](/images/env_var.png)

And configured   circle.yml:
```yaml
- mkdir -p $ANDROID_HOME/licenses
- echo $ANDROID_SDK_LICENSE > $ANDROID_HOME/licenses/android-sdk-license
```

**Now everything works perfect!**

The whole circle.yml file can be found [here](https://github.com/rustamgaifullin/TranslateIt/blob/master/circle.yml)
