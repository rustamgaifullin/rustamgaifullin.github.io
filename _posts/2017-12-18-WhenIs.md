Kotlin introduced handy operator called _when_ instead of _switch_ in Java.
```kotlin
when (x) {
    1 -> print("x == 1")
    2 -> print("x == 2")
    else -> { // Note the block
        print("x is neither 1 nor 2")
    }
}
```

It's pretty straightforward how to use _when_ in Kotlin and looks clean and simple.

Let's take another example a little bit more advanced then just a numbers.
Imagine that you have two classes _Foo_ and _Bar_ inherited from _Foo_:
```kotlin
open class Foo {}

class Bar: Foo() {}
```
Let's write a function which will return a string message based on instance of a class.
```kotlin
fun getFooOrBar(fooOrBar: Foo): String {
    return when (fooOrBar) {
        is Foo -> "Foo"
        is Bar -> "Bar"
        else -> "Unknown"
    }
}
```
And call _getFooOrBar()_ &nbsp;function with _Bar_ instance
```kotlin
println(getFooOrBar(Bar()))
```
What do you think will be printed? Right, the result will be "Foo" not "Bar".

Here's what happened here.
_Bar_ is a child of _Foo_ and _is_ operator will conform that _Bar_ instance of _Foo_.
In _when_ operator as soon as branch condition satisfied it will return string value and stopped working (which is expected).<br/>
In other words first condition will be satisfied hence result will be "Foo" for _Bar_ instance.  

Luckily in that case Intellij IDEA gave us a proper warning:
![Warning](/images/intellij_warning.png)

But now always.<br/>
When you use instances of Java classes in _when_ operator you will not see any warnings.
![Warning](/images/intellij_no_warning.png)

And if you call the function in example above:
```kotlin
println(getMessageForException(UnknownHostException()))
```
Result will be "IOException" message.

### Conclusion
Sequence does matter when you use _when_ and _is_ operators. <br/>
Don't always trust on your IDE.
